This training program focuses on implementing resizing and positioning
elements using the Go language of the Fyne library. You will learn how
to create a user-friendly registration form, where elements such as
text fields, buttons, labels, and checkboxes can be adjusted in size
and positioned precisely within the form's layout. This program will
provide hands-on exercises and guidance on leveraging the Fyne library's
capabilities to create a dynamic and visually appealing user interface
for your registration form.
